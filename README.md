This is a network based algorithm for the identificationof subtypes (clusters) in heterogenous and temporal data. the clusters are not just on similarity in variables, but also similarity in the 'trajectory' (temporal evolution patterns of these variables). We apply this to parkinson's, but the can be extended to any other heterogenous and longitudinal dataset. 
Algorithm for subtype identification based on: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05338
Data used: Parkinson's PPMI data including clinical, genetic and demographic data from Parkinson's patients.
The BL_V0x files are the data about values of symptoms for individuals (charecterized by patient number) in year x of having parkinsons.
